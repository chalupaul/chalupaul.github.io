    Hi. My name is Paul Sims. Pleased to meet you. If this site 
    seems to be all over the place, that's somewhat intentional.
    I talk here about tech, RPG gaming, fishing, kayaking, 
    gardening, fishing, cooking, and other things that interest
    me.

    If you're curious about the name "chalupaul", it's because
    you can't spell chalupa without paul. 
  
ttrpg: 
  intro: >
    I play a pretty silly amount of role playing games. Mainly
    Dungeons & Dragons 5e, Numenera, and various other systems.
  details: >
    Most of the info on this blog will be about my thoughts on
    game systems--things I like, features that don't work so well,
    etc.
  
tech:
  intro: >
    Half developer, half engineer--these days, I am focused on
    integrating infrastructure and applications with OpenStack,
    specifically targeting solutions for enterprises who are
    hitting hurdles adopting cloud computing.

    I am passionate about transforming all areas of traditional 
    IT into cloud models, such as evolving cloud application design,
    using DevOps for continuous product delivery and designing
    software-driven infrastructure.
