So, I am starting the old blog engine back up, but this time focused on tech things first, and ramblings second. Who knows, rambles may be easier to make.

I am giving github pages a shot for a few reasons. For starters, I'm hoping the text first approach means it'll be easier to update. This is the first blog I've started that I haven't also written the software behind. It's a good way to learn languages.

I had an [old site][atsknf] (link probably doesn't work) of my last one. I whipped it up in grails. Now that I'm on a macbook air, I don't have the horsepower for huge java IDEs or their gigantic frameworks any more, so the site'll probably get re-written at some point. I don't have any plans for playing 40k again so who knows. Maybe I won't get around to it. ;)

I'm working on a generic cli rest client, where you can plug in a schema to it. It's sort of like [google's service discovery][gsd]. I'm not sure how generic it can be made since it's for a specific project, but if I get anything together I'll drop it in github.
