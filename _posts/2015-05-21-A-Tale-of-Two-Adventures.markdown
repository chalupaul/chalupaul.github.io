Imagine you're talking to a town mayor, old and wise. But he's visually worried and heavy hearted. He tells you a dragon has landed in the north part of the city, and has taken some orphans as slaves to raise into warriors. The town magi planned to stop him, but the dragon killed the chief wizard before they had a chance to mount an offensive. The dragon stole a powerful artifact that could potentially grant him the power to control the entire city, if not this region. Can you and your adventurering party help? We don't have much but we'll pay you everything we have left. You can even keep the spell scrolls the dragon stole if you return the artifact to the tower of magi.

This I believe is a great example of an adventure hook, if a bit generic. It sets up the stage, provides enemy back story, presents clear goals to the players, and why they would be compelled to help. It is also very open ended. If you break the artifact, but can't kill the dragon or chase him off, you can still aleviate the regional threat. If you don't take the city's gold reserves as payment, they can rebuild and will owe your party huge favors. You could do a similar thing with the spell scrolls in helping to train up some of the more novice wizards in teh tower. 

It also has the potential for some really cool fights. The dragon probably has minions that are herding the orphans. You can rescue a few orphans to get secrets about the enemy movements, provide color and flavor to the captors thru the voice of children (very powerful motivator right there), and you can even have a tense fight where you're protecting orphans while fighting and maybe someone would valiently jump in front of an attack to save an orphan from a breath weapon and be a *real* hero.

I was in the mood for a good fantasy sword and sorcery adventure this would be fun right? I think most people can make adventures that are this good. But I very rarely see execution that matches up to the expectation. If you have engaged players, this adventure will practically write itself, which is a great experience. But if you were to see this in a published book from WotC or in an adventurer's league game, it would go something like this:

1) You RP with villagers, the mayor, and some potential thug spies in the village for about 90 minutes.
2) You fight some thugs on the way there. If you outed to the thug spies, you don't get ambushed.
3) At the orphanage, your first few fights won't make sense but will set the stage. Probably rats in the kitchen, an ooze or 2 in the basement, and a simple trap. You'll find 250ish gp in weird places (the sugar jar, in a chest in the basement, etc).
4) 2-3 more fights. One will have a neat puzzle or trap that is interesting because all the other rooms are empty except for furniture and weird smells. This will mostly be thugs. Maybe you'll rescue an orphan who will tell you about the dragon before she hides in the coat rack. You can use these encounters to buy another 200gp in exchange for some hp and a level 2 spell slot. You will find an oil of etherealness in a closet.
5) You'll fight the thug prince and the dragon together, maybe with another minion or 2. The thug prince uses the spell scrolls. The dragon won't have legendary/lair actions. The orphans are locked in the back room, out of the way.
6) You find the whatever it's called and return it to the mayor guy along with a dozen brats. He thanks you and gives you 1000gp. Oh, the thug prince also had an immovable rod on him for some reason.

So that sounds... kind of lame. I mean, it isn't bad per say, it's just... boring and un-epic. Some of these things are complaints about 5e, which maybe I should just put in one post. But many of them are about poor encounter design. Oh. And I've been playing 5e for a while now. I've DM'd a ton of games, played even more, and have so many characters floating around that I forget about them from time to time. And let me tell you, if you don't routinely have experiences like the one I just laid out, you are in the minority. So where did we go wrong?


Enemies without Purpose
-----------------------

In the example with the dragon/orphans (and I could have used any encounter from published books or adventures league), most of the fights there are to either make players use resources, fill in empty rooms, or be privileged enough to progress the story. Rooms are _far_ too static, and most of the enemies are basically waiting there to die. Bleak all around.

Also, why are there always random enemies like oozes and rats hanging out in inconsequential rooms? Or if you walk into a deserted village, every room has 3-6 zombies. The same stuff everywhere, and it's unvaried and purposeless. 


Lame Traps and Puzzles
----------------------

I understand why adventures league doesn't have scary traps or interesting puzzles. In 3.5/pathfinder, if you don't have a rogue, you can't do the dungeon. And puzzles are 1) hard to write, 2) take a long time, and 3) become hard stops for the party.
